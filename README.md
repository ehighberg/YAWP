# YAWP


## Project Description

YAWP is a simple weather service querying app, with native generation and rendering of [climate maps](https://openweathermap.org/weathermap?basemap=map&cities=false&layer=temperature&lat=30&lon=-20&zoom=3) (pressure / temperature). 


## Wireframes

#### TODO


#### MVP 

- Find and use external api (Open Weather and Mapbox)
- Render data on page (popup at user's search location, and a few other places nearby)
- Save favorite locations for later

#### PostMVP 

- Retrieve weather forecasts
- Simplest possible temp / wind model for native forecasting ( <6 hours)
- User filtering of returned data, with option to continously display a couple fields for each pin
